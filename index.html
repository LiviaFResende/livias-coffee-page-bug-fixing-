                <h2> My Childhood </h2>
                <p> During my whole childhood I had the influence of my parents, coffee lovers number 1 in my life.
                    <br>It would have no day without a smell of coffee comign from the kitchen in the morning... I still
                    miss that..

                <h2> Single Origin Passion </h2>
                <p> Everything started with a friend that I use to meet at some nice and new cafes in Brazil at lunch
                    time.<br>
                    We acquire the habit of look for new nice places, just because we were architects, but we fell in
                    love with coffee styles.<br>

                <p> So, because of all this passion that started..<br>
                    I decided to study more about coffee and decided to come to Australia for that, in 2016.
